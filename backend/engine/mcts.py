"""Adversarial MCTS implementation.

This MCTS alternates player and enemy turns:
Player -> Enemy -> Player -> Enemy ...

Phases implemented with comments:
- Selection: traverse tree using UCT, with enemy nodes preferring to minimize
  the player's expected reward (we flip exploit sign for enemy nodes).
- Expansion: add one new child (untried player action OR sampled enemy action).
- Simulation (rollout): run random alternation for a fixed depth and return the
  final `success_probability` (player's reward in [0,1]).
- Backpropagation: propagate reward back up the tree. Selection uses visits/value
  to compute UCT; at the root we return the best player action (highest visits).
